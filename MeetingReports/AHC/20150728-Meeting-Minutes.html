The position functions as a vendor relationship manager to assist the AHC in its legislatively mandated duty of providing oversight of the portal provider. Acting Chair DeMello noted that the position description was updated stating that the Portal Project Manager reports to the CIO, which had not yet been established when the position description was first drafted. </span></p></div></div></div><p> </p><p><strong>V.             </strong><strong>Renewal of the Portal Manager Contract  </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><div class="page" title="Page 2"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span>Acting Chair DeMello noted that at the June 1, 2015 AHC meeting, Member Nacapuy recommended the committee meet again in July to further discuss the Portal Manager contract and allow Hawaii Information Consortium (HIC), the <a href="http://eHawaii.gov" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">eHawaii.gov</a> portal manager, to provide a list of projects and </span><span>“</span><span>return on investment.</span><span>” </span></p><p><span>Acting Chair DeMello invited HIC General Manager Russell Castagnaro to introduce his guest, </span><span>Scott Somerhalder, Vice President of Operation, NIC Inc., which is HIC’s parent </span><span>company. </span></p><div class="page" title="Page 3"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span>Mr. Castagnaro introduced Mr. Somerhalder, who explained that HIC is one of nine businesses of NIC. Mr. Somerhalder gave a brief history of the self-enterprise/self-funded model and comparisons to other states. Together, they shared the following: eHawaii provides 110 services with benefit to citizen and businesses</span><span>. HIC’s goal is to address </span><span>how we change the way citizens and businesses interact. Approximately 64 percent of these services are non- revenue generating. About 30 states have chosen the self-funded model; it was presumed that is because no appropriation is needed to get it up and running. Examples of value included ease of access to information not previously available and improved quality of the data; however, some benefits are not always visible. </span></p><p><span>Castagnaro estimated that in 2014 HIC provided $6.4 million in benefit to the State and Counties -- 47,000 hours of developer work valued at $8.4 million if taken to Tier 1 or Tier 2 consultant companies. Various other, non-HIC projects were cited as not being as successful while costing tax-payers significantly more, including the recently canceled Department of </span><span>Transportation’s FAST project, past Department of Taxation modernization </span><span>efforts, and the Department of Human Services KOLEA project that, while functional, cost upwards of $100- 150 million. HIC has successfully partnered with the Departments of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Land and Natural Resources, and Taxation, as well as the Judiciary Branch on projects that avoided-costs estimated to be $4.6 million, and each of their projects requires director or administrative sign-off. </span></p><p><span>Member Verkerke asked the Chair whether other vendors would be provided the opportunity to present. Acting Chair DeMello responded by saying the procurement process would provide that opportunity, and that HIC, as the current provider, was tasked with providing the information by the AHC at its last meeting. </span></p><p><span>Designee Jones made a motion that the AHC extend the Portal Manager contract for a three- year period. Member Rep. Lee seconded. </span></p><p><span>During discussion, Designee Jones explained that the three year period would allow time for the development of a new Request for Proposals (RFP), award the contract, and transition between contractors if there is a change in vendor. </span></p><p><span>Member Rep. Lee expressed that departments and the public appear to be happy with HIC’s </span><span>services which they have won awards for. He noted that the three year extension would allow AHC the time to develop and issue a new RFP. Member </span><span>Colόn </span><span>affirmed this. </span></p><p><span>Member Verkerke asked if the committee needed to vote on whether to do an RFP at this time. </span><span>The answer was “no”. </span><span>Ms. Youngling from SPO indicated that that is a separate issue from extending the contract. She clarified that the current contract is not an indefinite contract. The contract can only be extended for another three years or any portion thereof. At the end of that period, AHC will have to decide again whether to extend for another three years or any portion thereof. Whether or not AHC wants to do another RFP can be discussed at a future meeting. </span></p><p><span>Acting Chair DeMello stated that it was OIMT’s position that the procurement could be </span><span>expedited, but the office defers to SPO. It was mentioned that a more thoughtful approach would be more prudent, and the hiring of the Portal Program Manager will facilitate this. Vote was taken and the motion unanimously passed. </span></p></div></div></div><p><span><br /></span></p></div></div></div><p><strong>VI.          Announcement</strong></p><p> </p><div class="page" title="Page 4"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span>Next regularly scheduled meeting: September 3, 2015 </span></p></div></div></div><p> </p><p><strong>VII.         </strong><strong>Adjournment</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><div class="page" title="Page 4"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p><span>Designee Jones made a motion to adjourn, which was seconded by Member </span><span>Colόn</span><span>.
