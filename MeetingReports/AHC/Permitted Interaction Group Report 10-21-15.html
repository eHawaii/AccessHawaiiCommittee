<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Background</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In 1999,
the State initiated the Internet Portal project with the goal of redesigning its
home page to have it serve as a web-based portal, or single access point, to
electronically deliver services and information to the public.&nbsp; To achieve
this goal, an RFP was issued for response from electronic business and Internet
portal providers.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In 2000,
the State entered into a contract with Hawai‘i Information Consortium (HIC), a
subsidiary of National Information Consortium (NIC).&nbsp; The contract called
for HIC to develop the internet portal based on a customer-centric approach
with a consistent user interface, and without increasing the tax burden on the
residents and businesses of Hawai‘i.&nbsp; As part of this contract, initial
investment capital for hardware, software, communications, facilities, and
other related items were provided by HIC at no cost to the State.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In 2008, a
new RFP for an internet portal provider was issued that added provisions for
web content management, time and materials projects fees, and hosting fees for
web-based and mobile applications.  Over the period of this contract, HIC
redesigned and hosted the State internet portal and provided an integrated
search engine.&nbsp; The key components of the portal system are a State “homepage”
(eHawaii.gov) that is designed from a customer or citizen point of view,
applications that support online processing of licenses, filings, permits,
applications, renewals, and database searches, and presentation of information
to citizens and businesses.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>In 2013,
eHawaii.gov was re-launched in conjunction with upgrades to webpages across all
State departments and agencies, enhanced mobile, touch and speech capability,
increased consistency, and improved accessibility.  Collaborating with State
government partners, the vendor has developed and is continuing to develop web
and mobile applications to deliver information and more than 100 online
services and websites to the public.  HIC has also promoted the portal to government
agencies, private and public organizations, while providing reporting user and
performance statistics to AHC, the oversight body.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>On July
28, 2015, the AHC unanimously voted to extend by three years the contract for
current provider, expressing satisfaction with the company but acknowledging
the need for more communication and reporting on value and benefit to the State. 
Also at the meeting, Derek Ichiyama was introduced as the recently hired State
internet portal program manager, who serves as the vendor relationship manager
and whose duties include evaluating the vendor’s activities and financial reports.
 The AHC tasked the PIG with recommending to the AHC if a new procurement
should be initiated.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Discussion</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoCommentText><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The
Group convened on September 15, 2015, with former Acting ICSD Administrator
Sharon Wong attending to provide contract history and background.  It was
determined that while the State Procurement Office administers the contract,
the lead agency is the Department of Accounting and General Services (DAGS)
with the AHC overseeing management of the contract.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoCommentText><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoCommentText><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Per
the RFP, which is made part of the contract by reference, Section 2.08.7 states
“Routine contract administrative activities will be implemented through the
AHC.  Final statutory and decision making authority for the contract resides
with the Contract Administrator…”  The RFP also states in Section 9.03.1 that,
for the purposes of this contract, the ICSD Data Processing Systems Manager or
his/her authorized representative is designated the Contract Administrator…”</span></p>

<p class=MsoCommentText><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Since the
contract may be extended for up to three years, without limit to the number of
extensions, the committee’s recommendations impact the initiation of the
procurement process.  Furthermore, the Group concurred with the AHC’s general
assessment that a new RFP, should one be warranted reflect any and all changes
in the scope of work from the original contract, and it is therefore prudent
and within the scope of the AHC’s mission to take an active role in developing
scope of services with input from appropriate agencies.  In addition, the AHC
is clearly made up of stakeholders and would be important in establishing
scope.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:black'>Recommendations</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>To
fulfill its purpose </span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>of
advising the AHC on the approach to whether to procure, the Group presents the
following recommendations:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst style='text-indent:-.25in'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>Development
of a Portal Program Functional List</span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;
color:black'> — HIC has operated under the current State contract since 2008,
and its roles and responsibilities, including added value services, have
expanded and evolved over time.  These functions have also adapted by necessity
to constantly changing technology and security requirements, as well as
Administration priorities.  Development of a comprehensive and accurate portal
program functional list representative of all services and activities performed
by the current provider is critical to determining State needs and will assist
in:  1) determining if a new procurement is needed; and 2) if so, a procurement
that not only meets current needs but anticipated future needs.  (Note:  Portal
Program Manager Derek Ichiyama reported that a project dashboard is currently
in development.)</span></p>

</span></span><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>Market
Research</span></b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'>
—  As a best practice, formal market research is an essential part of
due-diligence to assess and compare Hawai‘i’s portal program contract model and
the services it provides in relation to other models and technologies utilized
elsewhere.  This research should include solutions employed by other states and
municipalities (self-funded models or otherwise).  It is recommended that such
research begin with the 2015 winners and finalists of the Best of the Web and
Digital Government Achievement Awards to provide examples of innovate use of
internet-based information resources and services.  The Group notes that adequate
research may require the assistance of third-party expertise, managed by Portal
Program Manager Ichiyama, and should allow a sufficient and reasonable
timeframe for thorough evaluation (estimated by the Group to be a minimum of a
six-month period).</span></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:black'> — By the nature of the
role of the State CIO and the position’s authority over State government
technology assets and resources, the vision and strategic plan of the CIO
should be a main consideration determining future needs of a portal manager
contract.  The AHC must work with the CIO, given that the CIO’s strategies
regarding the allocation of IT workforce and program resources will have an
impact on program implementation and funding, even if the self-funded model is
continued.  Additional consideration should be given to the Ige
Administration’s overarching priority area of an “</span><strong>Effective,

suggesting an emphasis on</span></strong><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>
