                    <p>Please write a few paragraphs or so about the hiepro project and any highlights from this year.  Discuss initial origins, new functionality, overperformance, anything that would make a good story!</p><h2 id="HIePROstory-Overview">Overview</h2><p>Introduced in August 2013, the Hawaii Electronic Procurement (HIePRO) System has experienced very strong user adoption and widespread acceptance in 2014. </p><p>HIEPRO successfully replaced the previous electronic procurement system. HIEPRO was implemented and is maintained by HIC at no cost to the State of Hawaii or SPO. All functionality that was available in the previous system can be handled in HIEPRO. Numerous process steps have been streamlined and enhanced, producing a consistently positive user experience and making the service both useable and accessible (ADA) was a big priority.</p><p>Extensive workflow processes have been migrated into the system to reduce unnecessary manual steps. Innovative ideas for future development have been recorded for future development on a platform that has gained national interest from numerous states across the country.  A cohesive and well trained Customer Support team effectively uses online chat, web based collaboration and ticketing systems, text messaging and email to work with the SPO and HIC project teams to ensure the highest levels of user satisfaction.  </p><p>A successful pattern of improvements/enhancements continues to push HIEPRO to the forefront of electronic procurement solutions. Most importantly, the users and SPO regularly and consistently compliment HIC on the ease of use, and now have become part of the collaborative fabric by requesting new features and/or subtle adjustments for future consideration.</p><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Throughout 2014, HIEPRO passed the projected first year goals for Dollar Amount of Contracts awarded, Number of Solicitations, and Number of Awards. These successful milestones have pleasantly surprised the HIEPRO project teams, who were concerned that vendors and new users would be slow to embrace the new electronic procurement solution.   Calendar year 2014 shows monthly percentage gains of between 15 and 40% in numerous categories related to solicitations created and awarded. </span></p><h2 id="HIePROstory-KeyFeatures"><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Key Features</span></h2><p><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">A public search function allows the general public to search for solicitations and awards. The information in the public search contains limited information. Users must login to the system to see detailed information. This real time presentation of public information resolved many issues regarding the double posting of information and the varied lag times related to the process of the previous system.</span></p><p>One of the key requirements for vendors to be awarded a contract is vendor compliance as required by the State of Hawaii and specifically, the SPO. A key feature of the vendor profile includes up to the minute cross checking of the compliance status with another HIC-SPO collaborative service Hawaii Compliance Express (<a href="https://vendors.ehawaii.gov" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://vendors.ehawaii.gov</a>). Most of the vendors who use HIEPRO were already users of the HCE system and were able to use the same login for HIEPRO.</p><p>HIEPRO also features Online Chat, an email form and the Hawaii Information Consortium (HIC) phone number to the HIC Customer Support team. This enables HIC  to field and respond to the many calls that the previous system's vendor support person handled.</p>
