JANUARY 1, 2014 THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2014</p><p align="center"> </p><p> </p><h2 id="id-2014ACHReport(fromAHC)-Introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Pursuant to Act 172/SLH 2007, the Access Hawaii Committee (AHC) submits its annual report to the 2015 Legislature.  This year’s report is comprised of a report by the portal manager, Hawaii Information Consortium, LLC (HIC), reflecting work it was authorized to do by the AHC in conjunction with various State and county agencies.</p><p> </p><h2 id="id-2014ACHReport(fromAHC)-Overview"><strong>Overview</strong></h2><p>The AHC provides oversight of the portal manager, including: 1) review of the annual strategic plan and periodic reports on potential new applications and services submitted by the portal manager; 2) review and approval of all charges to portal users; 3) review and approval of service level agreements negotiated by government agencies with the portal manager; 4) review of the annual financial reports and audit of the portal manager; 5) review of annual customer satisfaction surveys conducted by the portal manager; and 6) review of performance measures of the portal submitted as part of the service management plan for portal-wide indicators and application specific indicators.</p><p> </p><p>The AHC exercised its oversight of the portal manager through a transition enabled by the passage of Act 172 of the 2007 Legislature.  The AHC operated as an informal committee beginning in July of 2005.  Act 110, SLH 2003 (SB1334, HD1), had sunset the AHC on July 1, 2005.  Because of the value of the oversight function provided by the AHC, the Committee, during the 2007 Legislative Session, submitted draft legislation which the Legislature passed as SB 1315, SD2, HD1, CD1, and which was enacted into law as Act 172 on June 13, 2007.  Act 172 re-enacted and codified substantive sections of Act 292, SLH 2000 (SB 2838, SD1, HD1, CD1), which was the original law that established the AHC.</p><p> </p><p>An amendment to the AHC law under Chapter 27G, Hawai‘i Revised Statutes, was enacted in the 2010 legislative session as Act 101 (HB2505, CD1).  The amendment to Chapter 27G created the AHC Special Fund within the Information and Communication Services Division (ICSD) of the Department of Accounting and General Services (DAGS) to support the AHC.</p><p> </p><p>The authorization of a position to serve as the portal program manager was requested during the 2011 legislative session.  A Governor’s Message submitted draft legislation which the Legislature passed as HB 200 HD1, CD1, which was enacted into law as Act 164 on July 1, 2011.</p><p> </p><p>During the 2013 legislative session, the Chief Information Officer of the State was added to the Access Hawaii Committee membership, and was designated as the chairperson of the committee.  The Legislature passed SB1000 SD1, which was enabled into law as Act 21 on April 19, 2013.</p><p> </p><p>New online government services are continually being added to the portal.  State and county agencies and their employees working with HIC have continuously identified new online services to be added to the State portal.  They have also worked hand-in-hand with HIC through the planning, implementation, and operational phases for these services.  As a result, government is more accessible to the public, which is being provided with added convenience, saving time conducting its business with government.  Citizens who choose to go online can conduct business with government from their homes and offices during the State’s business and non-business hours.</p><p> </p><p>The portal’s success has been achieved through the work of HIC, in conjunction with the AHC, the Office of Information Management and Technology, and the business and information technology staffs of the State agencies, the counties, and the Judiciary.  The HIC contract was renewed through competitive solicitation effective January 2008 for the initial five-year period, and the first contract extension was approved by the AHC beginning January 4, 2013 for an additional three years.</p><p> </p><h2

December 31, 2014:</p><h2 id="id-2014ACHReport(fromAHC)-.5"> </h2><h3 id="id-2014ACHReport(fromAHC)-2014LegislativeBudgetRequestApproved"><u>2014 Legislative Budget Request Approved</u></h3><p>At the 2014 Legislative Session, the supplemental budget request to increase the Access Hawaii Committee special fund appropriation ceiling from $90,016 to $150,000 was approved.</p><p> </p><h3 id="id-2014ACHReport(fromAHC)-PortalProgramManagerPosition"><u>Portal Program Manager Position</u></h3><p>Recruitment of this position is ongoing. </p><p> </p><h3 id="id-2014ACHReport(fromAHC)-AHCSpecialFundCollection"><u>AHC Special Fund Collection</u></h3><p>At the June 6, 2013 AHC meeting, the committee voted to suspend the monthly portal manager fee paid by Hawaii Information Consortium (HIC) to the AHC special fund when the fund accumulates a two-year reserve. </p><p> </p><p>As of July 1, 2014, collection of the monthly portal manager fee paid by Hawaii Information Consortium (HIC) to the AHC special fund resumed.  Because the special fund appropriation ceiling increased to $150,000, the fund balance is below the two-year reserve.</p><p> </p><h3 id="id-2014ACHReport(fromAHC)-ServicesProvidedInLieuofCollectingtheMonthlyPortalManagerFee"><u>Services Provided In Lieu of Collecting the Monthly Portal Manager Fee</u></h3><p>HIC provided two status reports, one for the period of June 6, 2013 to January 31, 2014, and the second for the period of February 1, 2014 to March 31, 2014.  These status reports provided the AHC with the services HIC provided directly to the AHC during the time that the monthly portal manager fee was suspended.  A Statement of Work (SOW) was executed between the AHC and HIC for the period of April 1, 2014 through June 30, 2014 that identified additional services provided during this period.  These additional services included accelerating work and progress on existing projects, an eGovernment services study, and administrative support to facilitate AHC meetings, including developing meeting agendas and meeting minutes.</p><p> </p><h2
