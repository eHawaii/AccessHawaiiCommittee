                    <p>Please write a few paragraphs or so about this app. How it happened, why it's important (first C&amp;C app woohoo!) and what it does...anything you'd like to share that would make a good story.</p><p>Thanks to connections via an HIC employee who left Honolulu Office of City Clerk on good terms, we were able to offer our services and make our first foray into working with this agency. It was a success story from day 1, when the cilent admired the sites we produced for the state. Their need was straightforward - transform a burdensome emailing ballot process to voters outside of the U.S. The partner was knowledgeable about the processes involved, the changes desired, and the deadline was external based on the upcoming election. Two HIC developers worked quickly and closely together using a great-looking design to produce a service that surpassed the client's expectations. Voters residing outside the U.S. now can receive an email with a single attachment that includes all required documents for them to send in a ballot without delay. Email notifications keep the election officials up-to-date regarding database updates and when emails were and were not sent. A report provides a log of all actions with the data, including voter downloads of ballots. And if a voter loses the email or decides they want an electronic ballot at the last minute, the election official can direct them to a web site where they can enter key information and download their ballot immediately.</p><p>We hope that this experience will be the first of many projects with the City and County of Honolulu!</p>
