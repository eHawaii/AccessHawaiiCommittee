                    <p>Effective January 1, 2015, the Medical Marijuana Program is transferred from the Department of Public Safety to Department of Health.  With the limited staff resource at the Department of Health, STD/AIDS Prevention Brach (DOH), HIC is in the process of creating an electronic Medical Marijuana Registry including historic data from the Public Safety program to  enable authorized physicians to register patients online, ultimately reducing DOH staff workload to maintain the registry.  This is an important program as it will enable better tracking and servicing of patients require medical marijuanaIt.  It also builds a good foundation to the possible establishment of a regulated statewide dispensary system for medical marijuana.</p><p>The <span>House Concurrent Resolution 48 (relating to Medical Marijuana Dispensaries) requested that the College of Social Sciences Public Policy Center convene and facilitate a Task Force to &quot;develop recommendations for the establishment of a regulated statewide dispensary system for medical marijuana.&quot;</span></p>
